# CPP-DSA-Journey
Welcome to CPP-DSA-Journey! This repository documents my adventure into learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++ from the ground up, starting May 1, 2025. With minimal prior experience, I‚Äôm diving in with enthusiasm and a commitment to growth. Whether you're a beginner or a curious coder, join me to explore, code, and learn together! üöÄ
About This Repository
This repo is my personal learning hub where I share well-documented C++ code, starting with fundamental problems and progressing to advanced DSA concepts. My goal is to build a strong foundation in DSA while creating a resource for others to follow along or code with me. Some folders may contain a ton of exercises, so I recommend going through them all‚Äîpractice makes perfect!
Getting Started
The code is written in C++ and organized into folders by topic or problem set. Each file includes clear explanations and comments to make it easy to understand and replicate.
Instructions for Learning
To get the most out of this repo, I encourage you to:

Try Solving Problems First: Attempt each problem without looking at the solutions, even if it takes more time. This builds problem-solving skills and deepens understanding.
Refer to Solutions Later: If you're stuck, check the provided solutions for guidance, but only after giving it a good try.
Practice Regularly: Work through all exercises in each folder. Repetition and persistence are key to mastering DSA.

How to Use This Repo

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/akahimanshurawat/CPP-DSA-Journey.git


Explore the Code: Open the .cpp files in your favorite IDE or text editor.
Run the Programs: Compile and run the C++ files using a compiler like g++.g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output


Code Along: Follow the comments in each file to understand the logic, attempt the problems yourself, and experiment with modifications.

Join the Journey
I‚Äôm sharing my progress openly and would love for you to join me! Here‚Äôs how:

Follow Along: Check the repo regularly for new problems and solutions.
Contribute: If you spot errors or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
Code Together: Use the files as a guide to practice DSA in C++ and share your solutions.

Feedback
This is my first-ever coding journey shared publicly, so I‚Äôm eager to learn and improve. If you have feedback, corrections, or tips, please let me know via GitHub issues or connect with me on LinkedIn (link to be updated).
What‚Äôs Next?
I‚Äôll be adding more problems weekly, moving from basic algorithms to complex data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and beyond. Some folders will be packed with exercises, so dive in and practice as much as you can‚Äîconsistency is the key to success! Stay tuned for updates, and let‚Äôs keep learning! üíª
